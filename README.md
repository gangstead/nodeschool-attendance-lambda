nodeschool-attendance-Lambda
============================

Version of the webhook created during the workshopper: https://github.com/gangstead/lambdalambdalambda
- This is used to track attendance in https://github.com/nodeschool/dallas
- An issue is created for each event.  The last comment before the issue is closed says something like "50 Meetup RSVPs, 30 people at meetup, 20 comments in the attendance issue"
- This webhook captures that comment and puts it in a google spreadsheet
- See the lambdalambdalambda workshop for deployment instructions
